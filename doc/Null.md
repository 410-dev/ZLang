# Documentation: NULL / null

**Description**

This is a foundational predefined value, which is considered as null.



### Usage

NULL and null is different, and must be clearly used in different situation.

NULL is a global (environment) variable that is considered as NULL throughout the library. The actual value of NULL is `b098c6b6ba804d12e96d29011fa660a9538f07f0e38bd9668f3d62b914bc6e170cc3df0359b50d9c4810562dd1ff27b54bed40d818f556ab4b08cf7a99124b66`.

null: It is a function that echos NULL.

Therefore, in order to have the same function for null as NULL, then it should be used as: `$(null)` whereas NULL could be used as `$NULL` or `${NULL}`.
